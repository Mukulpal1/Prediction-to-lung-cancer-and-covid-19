# Prediction of Lung Cancer and COVID-19 using CNN Algorithm

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of lung cancer and COVID-19 infection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to medical imaging data. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving treatment outcomes and patient survival rates.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of medical images such as X-rays and CT scans, paired with labels indicating the presence or absence of lung cancer and COVID-19. The dataset is sourced from [mention data source or repository link if applicable].

### CNN Architecture
The project utilizes a CNN architecture tailored for medical image analysis. The CNN model is designed to:

Extract meaningful features from medical images.
Learn to classify images as either showing signs of lung cancer or COVID-19.
### Features
**Data Preprocessing:** Includes image normalization, resizing, and augmentation to enhance model generalization.
<br>
**Model Training:** Scripts for training the CNN model on the provided dataset.
<br>
**Evaluation: Metrics** such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC are used to evaluate the model's performance.
<br>
**Inference:** Scripts for making predictions using the trained CNN model on new medical images.
